  {"id":"sajdaMachineLearningDetection2006","abstract":"Machine learning offers a principled approach for developing sophisticated, automatic, and objective algorithms for analysis of high-dimensional and multimodal biomedical data. This review focuses on several advances in the state of the art that have shown promise in improving detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic monitoring of disease. Key in the advancement has been the development of a more in-depth understanding and theoretical analysis of critical issues related to algorithmic construction and learning theory. These include trade-offs for maximizing generalization performance, use of physically realistic constraints, and incorporation of prior knowledge and uncertainty. The review describes recent developments in machine learning, focusing on supervised and unsupervised linear methods and Bayesian inference, which have made significant impacts in the detection and diagnosis of disease in biomedicine. We describe the different methodologies and, for each, provide examples of their application to specific domains in biomedical diagnostics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Sajda","given":"Paul"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.bioeng.8.061505.095802","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"537-565","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Machine Learning for Detection and Diagnosis of Disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.bioeng.8.061505.095802","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"schmidtRecentAdvancesApplications2019","abstract":"One of the most exciting tools that have entered the material science toolbox in recent years is machine learning. This collection of statistical methods has already proved to be capable of considerably speeding up both fundamental and applied research. At present, we are witnessing an explosion of works that develop and apply machine learning to solid-state systems. We provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the most recent research in this topic. As a starting point, we introduce machine learning principles, algorithms, descriptors, and databases in materials science. We continue with the description of different machine learning approaches for the discovery of stable materials and the prediction of their crystal structure. Then we discuss research in numerous quantitative structure–property relationships and various approaches for the replacement of first-principle methods by machine learning. We review how active learning and surrogate-based optimization can be applied to improve the rational design process and related examples of applications. Two major questions are always the interpretability of and the physical understanding gained from machine learning models. We consider therefore the different facets of interpretability and their importance in materials science. Finally, we propose solutions and future research paths for various challenges in computational materials science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Marques","given":"Mário R.
